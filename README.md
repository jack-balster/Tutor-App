Tutor app that handles the functionality of the WSU tutor center. There are three user types: students, tutors, and admins. Students can create accounts, schedule appointments with tutors, review tutors, etc. Tutor accounts are assigned and they can schedule what times they are free and cancel if necessary. Admins are also assigned and can edit tutor information, edit schedules, add/delete classes and majors for tutoring, and view tutor report statistics. Note there are many other features such as confirmation emails, forgot password handling, and more that expand upon the current WSU tutoring center portal.
